  <!-- Intro -->
  <section class="step">
    <p>I feel like there are a lot of representational forms that I take for granted that didn’t always exist. Like, the novel has a history, or even something like historical timelines. The use of genealogical charts is actually pretty recent. The idea that you have the present on the right and history stretching backward on the left—that’s not universal. The first one, I think, was created as a timeline of biblical figures, where Methuselah is way back here, Adam and Eve are at the start, and all the others follow. And the first of those was created by Joseph Priestley in the 18th century. That’s pretty recent.</p>
    <img src="timeline.gif" alt="Joseph Priestley's Chart of Biography" style="max-width: 100%; margin: 2em 0; border: 1px solid #ccc;" />
    <p>I mean just the idea that the present is on the right—that seems to be indicative of a sense of time as progress, right, or as a sentence that you decode? The form is already embedding assumptions.</p>
    <p>The idea that ways of representing things have a history is connected in my head to what Jameson’s saying. He’s saying we need new forms to get started.</p>

  <!-- Stylised Quote Section -->
  <section class="step quote">
    <p>
      I am addressing a subject about which I know nothing whatsoever, except for the fact that it does not exist. The description of a new aesthetic, or the call for it, or its prediction—these things are generally done by practicing artists whose manifestos articulate the originality they hope for in their own work, or by critics who think they already have before their eyes the stirrings and emergences of the radically new. Unfortunately, I can claim neither of those positions, and since I am not even sure how to imagine the kind of art I want to propose here, let alone affirm its possibility, it may well be wondered what kind of an operation this will be, to produce the concept of something we cannot imagine.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Cyclicality Section + Sine Wave -->
  <section class="step">
    <p>I don’t know enough about it, but—do you have to create some kind of totality in order to position a point of departure, whatever that point might be? And does there have to be some kind of cyclicality?</p>

    <div class="wave-container">
      <canvas id="sineWave"></canvas>
    </div>

    <p>Or—I don’t know, how is he suggesting that there has to be a sense of wholeness through form?</p>
    <p>Someone like Foucault does that very well when he creates a mode of analysis that is, quite literally, a map of history and time. With archaeology, you have surface-level structures—language—and then deeper epistemic formations, layers of meaning beneath.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Continue text... -->
  <section class="step">
    <p>But the issue with that is that he was accused—or at least perceived—as creating a system of totality and trapping himself within it. That’s a critique that came from Edward Said, who argued that you don’t need totality, you don’t need a cognitive map per se.</p>
    <p>So that’s what I’m wondering—what kind of relation does Jameson’s idea of a map or cognitive terrain have to this? Is it something more unsettled in the way he approaches it? I don’t know.</p>
